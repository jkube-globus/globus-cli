= Contributing to the Globus CLI

First off, thank you so much for taking the time to contribute! :+1:

This document is meant to help you get started and save you time.
It is **not** meant to be a barrier or hurdle.
Don't be afraid to open incomplete PRs and ask questions!

No contribution is too small. Typo and grammar fixes are welcome.

== Reporting Bugs & Requesting Features

  - Check if there's a matching
      https://github.com/globus/globus-cli/issues[issue]
      before opening a new issue or pull request
  - When possible, provide a usage example to reproduce bugs

== Getting Started & Interactive Development

These steps should help you setup a development environment for the Globus CLI
in which you can interactively write and test commands.

  1. Create a fork of the globus/globus-cli repository.

     Follow https://github.com/globus/globus-cli/fork in a browser.

  2. Clone your forked repository & navigate to it.

     git clone <fork-repo-url> && cd globus-cli

  3. Install dependencies in a local virtualenv for development.

     make install

  4. Activate the resulting virtualenv.

     source .venv/bin/activate

You should now have, in your virtualenv, the `globus-cli` installed, pointed at
your local copy of the repo. `globus` will invoke code directly out of the
repo.

== Running Tests

We use `tox` to run our tests against all supported Python versions.

You can use a tool like `pyenv` to install all of the Python versions, or
install `uv` and the `tox-uv` plugin to have `uv` manage the interpreter versions for you.
(`tox-uv` will also use `uv` to provision test environments.)

For example:

    uv tool install tox --with=tox-uv
    # or
    pipx install tox
    pipx inject tox tox-uv

Once installed, you can run all tests with:

    tox run

[TIP]
====
Try `tox l` to list environments, `tox r` as a shorthand for `tox run`, and
`tox p` to run tests in parallel.

To run a single environment, use the `-e` flag, for example: `tox r -e py3.13`.
====

== Linting, Formatting, & Type Checking

We use `pre-commit` to run (optional) pre-commit hooks for linting and formatting.
Use `pre-commit install` if you want to setup the hooks locally.

Code is also type-checked with `mypy`, which you can run with `tox run -e mypy`.

== Changelogs

Most changes to CLI functionality should be included in the changelog.

Pull Requests must have a changelog fragment or be approved by a maintainer to not need one.

See link:./changelog.d/README.adoc[the changelog doc] for information about
how to create fragments for your changes.

Maintainers use the `no-news-is-good-news` label to indicate that no changelog is needed.

== Releasing a Version

If you are a CLI maintainer, you need to be able to do a release.
For steps, see the link:./RELEASING.adoc[RELEASING doc].
